## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does It Work?

1. The user enters two numbers into `TextBox1` and `TextBox2`.
2. The relevant operation button is clicked (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).
3. The code performs the following operations:

- Converts the contents of `TextBox.Text` to a number using `Convert.ToDouble(...)`.
- Performs the selected operation.
- Displays the result on the screen using `label1.Text`.
4. If an invalid entry is made, a warning message is displayed using the `try-catch` block:
- "Please enter a valid number!"

- If `0` is entered during the division operation, a separate warning is displayed: `"A number cannot be divided by 0!"`
